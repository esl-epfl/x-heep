# Example Makefile that uses this external.mk file to access X-HEEP targets and build software from directories outside X-HEEP can be found in eXtendingHEEP.md
# It is crucial that the 'include' directive is located after all your rules as it will catch any target that was not defined in your Makefile.


MAKE	= make

# Furthermore, a variable HEEP_DIR with the relative path between that directory and the X-HEEP base directory (where this file is lcoated) needs to be exported.
# This will compute the opposite relative path (from the X-HEEP base directory to where this file is included).
HEEP_REL_PATH = $(shell realpath --relative-to=$(HEEP_DIR) ".")

# This assumes that you are including this file from a directory where you have a "sw" directory.
# When this path is provided to sw/Makefile, it will be the relative path from there to the uppermost sw directory.
SW_TO_SW_REL_PATH = ../$(HEEP_REL_PATH)/sw/

# If a custom path wants to be provided (i.e. software sources will not be inside a sw directory), it should be specified by setting this variable when calling make.
SOURCE ?= $(SW_TO_SW_REL_PATH)

# Any target that was not present on the uppermost Makefile (the one in which this file is included) will be passed to the X-HEEP Makefile.
