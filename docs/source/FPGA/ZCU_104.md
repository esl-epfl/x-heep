# FPGA ZCU104: Getting Started & Flash Programming Guide

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up, debugging, and programming the ZCU104 FPGA board. It assumes that you have already generated the bitstream and installed the necessary tools. Please refer to the following before proceeding:

- [Bitstream Generation Guide](./../RunOnFPGA.md)
- [ICEProg Installation Guide](./../How_to/ProgramFlash.md)

1. **Power Up the Board**
   - Connect the power supply as shown in the schematics **(1)**.
   - Turn on the board using the power switch  **(2)**.

2. **Connect USB**
   - Use a USB cable **(3)** to connect your development machine to the board.

3. **Ensure Vivado Board Files Are Installed**
   - Vivado must be able to recognize the ZCU104 board. Ensure the board files are placed in the following directory:
     ```
     <Vivado_Install_Dir>/data/boards/board_files
     ```
   - You can obtain the board files either from:
     - [Xilinx Official ZCU104 Page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.html)
     - [XHEEP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xheep)

4. **Connect the Flash**
   - Connect the external flash module to the board as illustrated in the schematics.

## Programming the Board


5. **Compile the App and program the flash**
   - Execute the `iceprog` script to flash the device.
   ```bash
   make app LINKER=flash_load TARGET=pynq-z104 PROJECT=hello_world
   ```

6. **Program the Flash**
   - Set the third switch on the board **up** (refer to the schematics for switch location).
   - When the device is correctly programmed, the ICEProg tool will show a **non-zero address**.
   - Set the switch back **down** to boot the software from flash.
   - To restart the application, press the **reset switch** (highlighted in yellow on the board).
   ```bash 
   make flash-prog
   ```


7. **(OPTIONAL: used for DEBUG) Open a Serial Connection (To see printf in the terminal)**
   - You can connect to the board's serial console using `picocom`. Run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   picocom -b 9600 -r -l --imap lfcrlf /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_Quad_RS232-HS-if02-port0
   ```

## Notes
- Refer to the schematics diagram included in the repo for switch and connection references.
- Always make sure the bitstream and Vivado configuration match your hardware revision.
