# Run on FPGA

This project offers X-HEEP implementetions on Xilinx FPGAs.


## Set-up
In this version, the X-HEEP architecture is implemented on the programmable logic (PL) side of the FPGA, and its input/output are connected to the available headers on the FPGA board.

Three FPGA boards are supported: the Xilinx Pynq-z2, Nexys-A7-100t, and the ZCU104.

1. Make sure you have the FPGA board files installed in your Vivado.
> For example, for the Pynq-Z2 board, use the documentation provided at the following [link](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5/overlay_design_methodology/board_settings.html) to download and install them.

2. Make sure you set up the Vivado environments by running
   ```
   source <vivado-installation-path>/settings64.sh
   ```
   > We recommend adding this command to your `.bashrc`

3. Install the Xilinx cable drivers.
* Follow the [instructions for Linux](https://docs.amd.com/api/khub/documents/6EIhov6ruoilhq8zq7bXBA/content?Ft-Calling-App=ft%2Fturnkey-portal&Ft-Calling-App-Version=4.3.26#G4.262534)
* Restart your PC

## Running

To build and program the bitstream for your FPGA with vivado, type:

```
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2
```

or

```
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=nexys-a7-100t
```

or add the flag `use_bscane_xilinx` to use the native Xilinx scanchain:

```
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2 FUSESOC_FLAGS=--flag=use_bscane_xilinx
```

To program the bitstream, open Vivado,

```
open --> Hardware Manager --> Open Target --> Autoconnect --> Program Device
```

and choose the file `openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_0.bit`.

Or simply type:

```
make vivado-fpga-pgm FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2
```

or

```
make vivado-fpga-pgm FPGA_BOARD=nexys-a7-100t
```

To run SW, follow the [Debug](./Debug.md) guide to load the binaries with the HS2 cable over JTAG,
or follow the [ExecuteFromFlash](./ExecuteFromFlash.md) guide if you have a FLASH attached to the FPGA.

Do not forget that the `pynq-z2` board requires you to have the ethernet cable attached to the board while running.

For example, if you want to run your application using flash_exec, do as follow:
compile your application, e.g. `make app PROJECT=example_matfadd TARGET=pynq-z2 ARCH=rv32imfc LINKER=flash_exec`
and then follow the [ExecuteFromFlash](./ExecuteFromFlash.md) to program the flash and set the boot buttons on the FPGA correctly.
To look at the output of your printf, run in another terminal:
`picocom -b 9600 -r -l --imap lfcrlf /dev/ttyUSB2`
Please be sure to use the right `ttyUSB` number (you can discover it with `dmesg --time-format iso | grep FTDI` for example).

## FPGA Utilizations

X-HEEP is a continuosly evolving design, therefore these numbers need to be updated from time to time.

As of today (`29.01.2025`), on a `pynq-z2` FPGA, X-HEEP utilizes:

### Small configuration


It contains few peripherals, 64kB of SRAM, the small bus, and the CV32E2 CPU with RV32IMC ISA extensions.

Generated as:

```
make mcu-gen MCU_CFG_PERIPHERALS=mcu_cfg_minimal.hjson
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2
```

| Resource         | Quantity        | Utilization (%) |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Slice LUTs       | 12.1K           | 22.7            |
| Slice Registers  | 12.1K           | 11.3            |
| RAM              | 16              | 11.4            |
| DSP              | 1               | 0.5             |


### Bigger configuration


It contains more peripherals, 64kB of SRAM, the wider bus, and the CV32E40P CPU with RV32IMFCXpulp ISA extensions.

Generated as:

```
make mcu-gen CPU=cv32e40p BUS=NtoM
make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2 FUSESOC_PARAM="--COREV_PULP=1 --FPU=1"
```
