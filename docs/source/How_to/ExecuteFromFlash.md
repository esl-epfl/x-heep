#  Execute Code from FLASH

## Boot Procedure

The microcontroller has a boot rom where the RISC-V CPU jumps to
at reset time.
The boot rom contains code for three different booting modesmodes:

1. JTAG
2. SPI Flash Execution
3. SPI Flash Loading

These three modes are mainly controlled by the two inputs pins
`boot_sel_i` and `execute_from_flash_i`.

| `boot_sel_i` | `execute_from_flash_i` | `boot procedure`     |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0			       | X				              | JTAG                 |
| 1			       | 1				              | SPI Flash Execution  |
| 1			       | 0				              | SPI Flash Loading    |


On the FPGA, such inputs are mapped to two switch buttons.
Below, a description of the three modes is provided.

### JTAG Boot Procedure

In this boot procedure, when the CPU enters the boot rom,
it loops forever. The JTAG programmer (e.g., openOCD) must
load the memory as described in `Debug.md` and set the
booting address. During this procedure, the CPU runs
in `debug mode` until the JTAG (e.g., GDB) tells it to start
executing the code.

To use this mode, when targetting ASICs or FPGA bitstreams,
make sure you have the `boot_sel_i` input (e.g., a switch) set to 0,
and connect the JTAG cable to the microcontroller.

The `Debug.md` guide gives details about how to program the microcontroller
in this mode.

For simulation targets, by default, the testbench uses this mode.
However, this procedure is very slow. For this reason, we use pre-loading instead.
While the CPU loops in the boot rom, it also checks a memory mapped flag that
the testbench can set to 1 after pre-loading the memories.
Then it loads the `boot_address` from a memory-mapped register that is set to
0x180 at reset time, which is also the boot address specified in the entry point of the
linked scripts.
If you want to simulate the actual JTAG procedure without pre-loading instead,
compile the RTL with the `FUSESOC_PARAM="--JTAG_DPI=1"` flag and follow the `Debug.md` guide.

### SPI Flash Execution Boot Procedure

In this boot procedure, when the CPU enters the boot rom,
it jumps to the FLASH to execute the code directly from it.
The FLASH is memory mapped starting at the address 0x400000000.
Thus, when the CPU tries to access that memory region, reading-only
operations are translated automatically by SPI transactions.
The SPI converts the memory operation by sending the
address's offset (i.e., the lower 24bits of the address) to the FLASH
and by reading from FLASH the instruction, which is then sent back to the CPU.
For this reason, executing code from FLASH is very slow.
We mainly use this mode as a second-stage boot procedure.
The first address where the CPU jumps to is 0x400000180,
which is also the entry point of the FLASH's linker script.
Note that the SW written in the FLASH is compiled with a different
linker script than the code compiled to be executed directly from the SRAM
as the code is mapped to a different memory region.
At booting time, first, the SPI sends the waking-up command to the FLASH,
then it sends the lower 24bits of the entry address, i.e., 0x000180.
The CPU then executes the instruction stored in the FLASH.

To use this mode, when targetting ASICs or FPGA bitstreams,
make sure you have the `boot_sel_i` input (e.g., a switch) set to 1,
and the `execute_from_flash_i` set to 1 too.

Note that the FLASH model is not `fully` compatible with **verilator**,
thus the simulation must be carried out with either **modelsim** or **vcs**.
The FLASH models requires a simulator capable of representing high-impedence states (`z`),
and the current **verilator** version does not support them.
However, high-impedence states are only required when reading in quad-mode, or 
when writing (in any mode) - thus reading only in single-mode from FLASH is supported in 
**verilator** as well (as for example booting from FLASH, where the bootrom and crt0 only reads in single-mode).
!! Note that it supports single-mode just because the **verilator** model is compiled in a way that bidirectional `MOSI/MISO` signals 
have been given priority to the FLASH, it may not be the case in future versions !!

Make sure to compile your SW using the link_flash_exec.ld linker script.

In this repository, we provide two examples to try, one for FPGA/ASIC
only, which toggles a GPIO forever (in simulation, this would never finish),
and the hello_world example.

To use the link_flash_exec.ld linker script, do:

```
make app LINKER=flash_exec
or
make app PROJECT=gpio_pmw LINKER=flash_exec
```
Then, when launching the simulation, pass the argument `boot_sel=1`
to set the `boot_sel_i` input to `1` and `execute_from_flash=1` to set the
`execute_from_flash_i` input to `1`.

```
make run PLUSARGS="c firmware=../../../sw/build/main.hex boot_sel=1 execute_from_flash=1"
```

If you are using FPGAs or ASIC, make sure to program the FLASH first.

Follow the [ProgramFlash](./ProgramFlash.md) guide to program the FLASH.


### SPI Flash Loading Boot Procedure

In this boot procedure, when the CPU enters the boot rom, it uses the OpenTitan SPI (SPI host) to copy the first 1KB content of the FLASH (starting at address 0) to the RAM (starting at address 0). Then, the CPU jumps to the entry point at 0x00000180 (in RAM) and executes the start function of the crt0 file (which is contained inside the 1KB copied in RAM). This function checks if the code is completely copied (i.e., less or equal to 1 KB); in this case, it jumps to the main function, or, if more code needs to be copied, it uses the OpenTitan SPI to copy the remaining bytes of code.

To use this mode, when targeting ASICs or FPGA bitstreams,
make sure you have the `boot_sel_i` input (e.g., a switch) set to 1,
and the `execute_from_flash_i` set to 0.

Make sure to compile your SW using the link_flash_load.ld linker script.

In this repository, we provide two examples to try, one for FPGA/ASIC
only, which toggles a GPIO forever (in simulation, this would never finish),
and the hello_world example.

To use the link_flash_load.ld linker script, do:

```
make app LINKER=flash_load
or
make app PROJECT=gpio_pmw LINKER=flash_load
```
Then, when launching the simulation, pass the argument `boot_sel=1`
to set the `boot_sel_i` input to `1` and `execute_from_flash=0` to set the
`execute_from_flash_i` input to `0`.

```
make run PLUSARGS="c firmware=../../../sw/build/main.hex boot_sel=1 execute_from_flash=0"
```

If you are using FPGAs or ASIC, make sure to program the FLASH first.
