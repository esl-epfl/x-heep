# Compile applications

All software applications can be found in `sw/applications`. These can be compiled with the `app` target of the top-level makefile of X-HEEP. To compile the `hello world` application with default parameters, just type:

```
make app
```

This will create the executable file to be loaded in your target system (ASIC, FPGA, Simulation). 
X-HEEP is using CMake to compile and link. Thus, the generated files after having compiled and linked are under `sw\build`.

```{warning}
Don't forget to set the `RISCV` env variable to the compiler folder (without the `/bin` included).
```

You can select the application to run, the target, compiler, etc. by modifying the parameters. The compiler flags explicitely specified by the user will override those already existing (e.g. the default optimization level is `-O2`, passing `COMPILER_FLAGS=-Os` will override the `-O2`). This can be used to pass preprocessor definitions (e.g. pasing `make app COMPILER_FLAGS=-DENABLE_PRINTF` is equivalent to adding `#define ENABLE_PRINTF` on all included files). 
```
app PROJECT=<folder_name_of_the_project_to_be_built> TARGET=sim(default),systemc,pynq-z2,nexys-a7-100t,zcu104 LINKER=on_chip(default),flash_load,flash_exec COMPILER=gcc(default),clang COMPILER_PREFIX=riscv32-unknown-(default) ARCH=rv32imc(default),<any_RISC-V_ISA_string_supported_by_the_CPU> 

Params:
    - PROJECT (ex: <folder_name_of_the_project_to_be_built>) 
    - TARGET (ex: sim(default),systemc,pynq-z2,nexys-a7-100t,zcu104) 
    - LINKER (ex: on_chip(default),flash_load,flash_exec) 
    - COMPILER (ex: gcc(default),clang) 
    - COMPILER_PREFIX (ex: riscv32-unknown-(default)) 
    - COMPILER_FLAGS (ex: -O0, "-Wall -l<library>")
    - ARCH (ex: rv32imc(default),<any_RISC-V_ISA_string_supported_by_the_CPU>)
```

```{note}
You can run `make help` or `make` to see the most up-to-date documentation for the makefile. This includes the parameters available for this command, as well as the documentation for all other commands. Also check the different `clean` commands in the makefile to verify that you are using the correct one.
```

For instance, to compile the `hello world` app with clang for the pynq-z2 FPGA, just run:

```
make app PROJECT=hello_world TARGET=pynq-z2 COMPILER=clang
```

## Using the OpenHW Group compiler

If you want to use the OpenHW Group [GCC](https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#corev) compiler with CORE_PULP extensions, make sure to point the `RISCV` env variable to the OpenHW Group compiler, then just run:

```
make app COMPILER_PREFIX=riscv32-corev- ARCH=rv32imc_zicsr_zifencei_xcvhwlp_xcvmem_xcvmac_xcvbi_xcvalu_xcvsimd_xcvbitmanip
```

## Compiling FreeRTOS based applications

X-HEEP supports FreeRTOS based applications. Please see `sw\applications\example_freertos_blinky`.

After that, you can run the command to compile and link the FreeRTOS based application. Please also set 'LINKER' and 'TARGET' parameters if needed.

```
make app PROJECT=example_freertos_blinky
```

The main FreeRTOS configuration is allocated under `sw\freertos`, in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`. Please, change this file based on your application requirements.
Moreover, FreeRTOS is being fetched from 'https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git' by CMake. Specifically, 'V10.5.1' is used. Finally, the fetch repository is located under `sw\build\_deps` after building.
