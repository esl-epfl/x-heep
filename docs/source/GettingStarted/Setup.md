# Setup

There are two ways of setting up X-HEEP. You can either use the provided docker image or install and configure the environment manually.

## Docker setup

A docker image containing all the required software dependancies is available on [github-packages](https://github.com/orgs/esl-epfl/packages/container/package/x-heep-toolchain).

It is only required to install docker and pull the image.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/esl-epfl/x-heep-toolchain:latest
```

Assuming that X-HEEP has been cloned to `X-HEEP-DIR=\absolute\path\to\x-HEEP\folder`, it is possible to directly run the docker mounting `X-HEEP-DIR` to the path `\workspace\x-heep` in the docker.

```bash
docker run -it -v ${X-HEEP-DIR}:/workspace/x-heep ghcr.io/esl-epfl/x-heep-toolchain
```

```{warning}
Take care to indicate the absolute path to the local clone of X-HEEP, otherwise docker will not be able to properly mount the local folder in the container.
```

The docker setup has certain limitations. For example, the following are not supported:

- Simulation with Questasim and VCS, synthesis with Design Compiler. Licenses are required to use these tools, so they are not installed in the container.

- OpenRoad flow is not installed in the container, so it is not possible to run the related make commands.

- Synthesis with Vivado could be possible, but currently is untested.

## Manual setup

### 1. OS requirements

To use `X-HEEP`, first make sure you have the following apt packages, or install them as:

```bash
sudo apt install lcov libelf1 libelf-dev libftdi1-2 libftdi1-dev libncurses5 libssl-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 lsb-release texinfo autoconf make cmake flex bison libexpat-dev gawk tree xterm python3-venv python3-dev
```

In general, have a look at the [Install required software](https://opentitan.org/guides/getting_started/index.html) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

### 2. Python

We rely on either (a) `miniconda`, or (b) `virtual environment` enviroment.

Choose between `2.a` or `2.b` to setup your enviroment.

#### 2.a Miniconda

Install [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) python 3.8 version by downloading an older version and selecting the latest `py38` version [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/). Then, create the Conda enviroment:

```bash
make conda
```

You need to do it only the first time, then just activate the environment everytime you work with `X-HEEP` as

```bash
conda activate core-v-mini-mcu
```

#### 2.b Virtual Environment

Install the python virtual environment just as:

```bash
make venv
```

You need to do it only the first time, then just activate the environment everytime you work with `X-HEEP` as

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the RISC-V Compiler:

```
git clone --branch 2022.01.17 --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/tools/riscv --with-abi=ilp32 --with-arch=rv32imc --with-cmodel=medlow
make
```

Then, you need to set the `RISCV` environment variable. Also consider adding it to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent so that it's set automatically in the future, like this:

```
export RISCV=/home/$USER/tools/riscv
```

Optionally you can also compile with clang/LLVM instead of gcc. For that you must install the clang compiler into the same `RISCV` path. The binaries of gcc and clang do not collide so you can have both residing in the same `RISCV` directory. For this you can set the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` cmake variable to `$RISCV` when building LLVM. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout llvmorg-14.0.0
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$RISCV -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="RISCV" ../llvm
cmake --build . --target install
```

### 4. Install Verilator:

Note that Verilator 4.210 will not build with GCC 12.0 or later, so it will need to be built with an older toolchain.

```
export VERILATOR_VERSION=4.210

git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
cd verilator
git checkout v$VERILATOR_VERSION

autoconf
./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION
make
make install
```

After installation you need to add `/home/$USER/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable. Also consider adding it to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent so that it's on the `PATH` in the future, like this:

```
export VERILATOR_VERSION=4.210
export PATH=/home/$USER/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION/bin:$PATH
```

In general, have a look at the [Install Verilator](https://opentitan.org/book/doc/getting_started/setup_verilator.html) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

If you want to see the vcd waveforms generated by the Verilator simulation, install GTKWAVE:

```
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
sudo apt-get install -y gtkwave
```

### 5. Install Verible

Files are formatted with Verible. We use version v0.0-1824-ga3b5bedf

```
export VERIBLE_VERSION=v0.0-1824-ga3b5bedf
wget https:wget https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/releases/download/${VERIBLE_VERSION}/verible-${VERIBLE_VERSION}-Ubuntu-20.04-focal-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xf verible-${VERIBLE_VERSION}-Ubuntu-20.04-focal-x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir -p /home/$USER/tools/verible/${VERIBLE_VERSION}/
mv verible-${VERIBLE_VERSION}/* /home/$USER/tools/verible/${VERIBLE_VERSION}/
rm verible-${VERIBLE_VERSION}-Ubuntu-20.04-focal-x86_64.tar.gz
rm -r verible-${VERIBLE_VERSION}
```

After installation you need to add `/home/$USER/tools/verible/${VERIBLE_VERSION}/bin` to your `PATH` environment variable. Also consider adding it to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent so that it's on the `PATH` in the future, like this:

```
export VERIBLE_VERSION=v0.0-1824-ga3b5bedf
export PATH=/home/$USER/tools/verible/${VERIBLE_VERSION}/bin:$PATH
```

In general, have a look at the [Install Verible](https://opentitan.org/book/doc/getting_started/index.html#step-7a-install-verible-optional) section of the OpenTitan documentation.
