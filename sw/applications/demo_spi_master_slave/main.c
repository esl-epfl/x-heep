 Description: This demo shows the exchange of data between two X-HEEP instances on two FPGAs. 
 Requirements: 
 * 2 pynq-z2 FPGAs
 * 2 EPFL programmers with two jumpers each
 * 5 female-female dupont cables (>10cm)
 * 4 female-male dupont cables (>10cm)
 * 3 USB-A to micro USB cables (or two power sources and one USB)

 Setup:
 1) Prepare the FPGAs. 
 1.a) Make the bitstreams of the FPGAs with make mcu-gen; make vivado-fpga FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2
 1.b) One at a time, power up the FPGAs (with the power source, or by connecting the USB).
      Make sure the jumper next to the switches is in REG if you are using the source, or USB if you are using the USB. 
 1.c) Turn on the FPGA (a red LED will light up), and program it: make vivado-fpga-pgm FPGA_BOARD=pynq-z2. LED3 should light up green.
 1.d) Without powering off the first FPGA, repeat the process for the other one. 
 1.e) Put SW1 towards the outside of the board, and SW0 towards the inside of the board (to let X-HEEP know it should load the program from flash)
 2) Load the programs
 2.a) Connect both EPFL programmers through the PMOD connectors to the FPGAs. 
 2.b) Make sure they both have the jumpers on. The power option should be USB.
 2.c) Build the application: make app PROJECT=demo_spi_master_slave 
 2.d) Connect one USB cable to one programmer and load the flash: make flash-prog   
 2.e) Click on the reset button (BTN3) and a red and green LED should start to flash. 
 2.f) Disconnect the USB from the programmer, and switch it's jumper to the PMOD option.
 2.g) Repeat the process with the other FPGA. 
 3) Connect the FPGAs
 3.a) On the top three lines of pins of the diagram below there are the SPI slave pins. Connect the ones from one board 
      to the master ones of the other board. The pins stand for:
      Syncronization (Sy), SPI clock (Ck), Chip select (Cs), Master-out-Slave-in (Mo), Master-in-Slave-out (Mi).
 4) Have fun
 4.a) Reset both boards. 
 4.b) The one that resets first (master) will light a red LED and start requesting a read from the slave (toggling a green LED). 
 4.c) The one that resets the last (slave) will turn the blue LED and go to sleep. 
 4.d) If the transaction is successful, the master will leave the green LED on and the last LED (LD0) will light up.
      If the transaction fails (common after the first syncronization), the master will leave the red LED on and both LD0 and LD1 will light up. 
 4.e) You can restart the demo by resetting the master. 
 4.f) You can invert the roles by resetting both and releasing first the former slave.

Disclaimer: 
The FPGAs can have different bitstreams as long as the pinout remains the same. 
The two softwares instead NEED TO BE THE SAME. We are cheating in this demo by using the same software in both FPGAs.
This allows us to know the address of the buffer with the data on the slave X-HEEP (because it is linked to the same
location as in the master!). Even adding one tiny printf on one of the devices might make this addresses to not match, 
so the application will fail (you will read from the wrong address).
