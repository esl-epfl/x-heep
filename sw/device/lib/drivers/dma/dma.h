/* 
 * For multichannel configurations, a priority mechanism can be set up to allow the interrupt handler 
 * to prioritize a set of channels.
 * 
 * In order to enable this feature, the user must define DMA_HP_INTR_INDEX.
 * 
 * When an interrupt is raised, the handler will loop through the channels. If the channel that
 * raised the interrupt is part of the high priority channels (index <= DMA_HP_INTR_INDEX), 
 * it will call the actual handler and exit the loop. 
 * It this way, low index channels will always be serviced first.
 * 
 * However, this feature could cause low priority channels to never be serviced if the high priority
 * interrupts are raised at a faster frequency.
 * In order to avoid this, the user can define DMA_NUM_HP_INTR (uint16_t).
 * This macro puts a limit to the number of consecutive interrupts raised by high priority channels 
 * that can trigger a "return".
 * If N = DMA_NUM_HP_INTR interrupts are raised by high priority channels, the N+1 interrupt will be
 * serviced and then no "return" will be triggered, thus allowing the handler's loop to continue and 
 * low priority channels to be serviced, if necessary.
 * 
 * The priority mechanism is applied to both transaction done and window done interrupts, if enabled.
 * Separate counters are used for each type of interrupt.
